# üéµ MoodMate: Emotion Detection and Music Recommendation System  

An intelligent system that detects a user‚Äôs emotional state from **facial expressions** or **text input** and recommends music that aligns with or enhances the user's mood using **AI/ML techniques**.  

---

## üìå Objectives
- Detect user emotions from **facial images** or **text**.  
- Integrate **computer vision / NLP** with recommendation systems.  
- Build a recommendation engine using **music metadata** and **emotion mapping**.  
- Deliver an interactive prototype with **real-time emotion-based music suggestions**.  

---

## üéØ Expected Outcomes
- Gain experience with **emotion detection** from images and text.  
- Learn to integrate **AI models** with recommendation systems.  
- Implement a **music recommendation engine** using metadata and similarity measures.  
- Create a working **interactive demo**.

## üìÖ Project Timeline (8 Weeks)

### **Milestone 1: Week 1 & 2 ‚Äî Requirements & Dataset Preparation**
- Define project scope and tech stack.  
- Download and explore FER-2013 and music datasets.  
- Clean and preprocess emotion image/text data.  
- Extract and organize music features (genre, mood, etc.).  

### **Milestone 2: Week 3 & 4 ‚Äî Emotion Detection System**
- Build and train a **CNN model** for facial emotion recognition or **BERT/LSTM** for sentiment analysis from text.  
- Test and evaluate the model on validation data.  
- Save emotion classification outputs for recommendation use.  

### **Milestone 3: Week 5 & 6 ‚Äî Music Recommendation Engine**
- Map detected emotions to relevant music tags (**happy, calm, sad, etc.**).  
- Build a **content-based filtering model** using cosine similarity or TF-IDF.  
- Integrate emotion detection with music recommendation.  
- Return real-time music suggestions.  

### **Milestone 4: Week 7 & 8 ‚Äî UI, Testing & Final Presentation**
- Develop a **front-end** for image upload/text input & playlist suggestion.  
- Perform real-time testing and validation.  
- Final documentation and deployment.  
- Prepare demo video and presentation.
